#DevSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/devspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:
- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/devspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:
- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions  
- Project structure and guidelines
- Complete command usage: /plan, /expand, /design, /proposal, /apply, /archive

## Documentation Directory
All project documentation and requirements should be saved in the `docs/` directory for centralized management and easy access.

Keep this managed block so 'devspec update' can refresh the instructions.
